aeroponic system
development is currently in alpha
- - -

# Introduction
The goal of this repository is to contain all the information needed to get, build and run an aeroponic system. The idea is to design a cheap modular system that any one can use.

The project is divided into two parts:
1. The development of a small test system which is intended for developers who are interested in running experiments on a small scale.
2. The production system which is closet sized with the focus on maximum production of biomass. Both systems are controlled by an Arduino Uno and can use the same hardware and software, the only difference will be the size.

Information about how to build and run the systems will be added to the wiki.

# TODO
* wiki
  * developer aeroponic system
	* electronics/sensors
	* pluming
	* buckets and growth environment
	* nutrient solution
	* LED system
  * production aeroponic system

# Software instructions
arduino - contains the arduino sketch file which you need to upload to your arduino uno.
gnuplot - contains a gnuplot settings file which can be used to plot data reported by the arduino.
processing - contains a processing sketch file which you can use with processing to get a simple user interface to the arduino. This makes it very easy to change the configuration of the system.
